**Abstract:** 

Graph signal processing represents an important advancement in the field of data analysis, extending conventional signal processing methodologies to complex networks and thereby facilitating the exploration of informative patterns and structures across various domains. However, acquiring the underlying graphs for specific applications remains a challenging task. While graph inference based on smooth graph signal representation has become one of the state-of-the-art methods, these approaches usually overlook the unique properties of networks, which are generally derived from domain-specific knowledge. Overlooking this information could make the approaches less interpretable and less effective overall. In this study, we propose a new graph inference method that leverages available domain knowledge. The proposed methodology is evaluated on the task of denoising and imputing missing sensor data, utilizing graph signal reconstruction techniques. The results demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge into the graph inference process can improve graph signal reconstruction in district heating networks.
